## Introduction
Delivering results in an uncertain world is as important now as it has ever been at GE. And so, I would like to share with your two appStudio related success stories, and highlight the great work of Ian Rajczi, Donovon Bacon, Josh Falter, Veena Sistla and Bai Yu. Collectively, they have executed and delivered results.
 
## tl;dr Summary
- appStudio in Aviation: Great example of re-use and self-service to accelerate execution and deliver outcomes.
- MOS: Setting culture, delivering results in the products 3rd appStudio to date, at the Detroit digital hub.
- Introduced the Lightning Decision Jam.

## Updates
### Aviation:
- Josh Falter has participated in the CICADA appStudio’s, his <a href="https://ge.box.com/s/959g7x87gzt58qs9sos1qvwlvpzhqqyt" target="_blank">Whitney Houston inspired sprint retro’s</a> are legendary. Josh recognized the opportunity to use an appStudio to allow the myGEAviation team to come together and accelerate in Cincinnati.
- The appStudio team was committed elsewhere, so we gave Josh and his scrum master access to the Box documentation, and consultation over skype.
- With strong leadership from Josh, the team worked focused and collaborated at speed. <a href="/assets/images/article-resources/appstudio-feedback-falter.jpg">Josh’s summary of the appStudio is linked</a>.
- _**Key takeaway**_: the appStudio fostered cultural change, allowing the process to be consumed in a self-service manner drives reuse within GE, allows teams to focus on executing and driving business value.
 
### MOS:
- This was the _**3rd appStudio for MOS**_, which is, of course, a highly mature product, delivering real value to GE. It was one week in duration and was seen as an opportunity to allow the team to reset on their practices through co-location and execution of the backlog.
- During the appStudio, Donovon Bacon introduced the _**Lightning Decision Jam**_, a 1-hour exercise for rapid decision making, that cuts out circular discussions and drives accountability in the solutions to problems. Francisco sees the value in adopting this for staff meetings and it is something we will work with him to make a regular part of his teams’ cadence.
- The big question from Francisco and team was _**how to continue the patterns learned in the appStudio**_, and run them where the teams sit. The appStudio team anticipated this need and a part of our 2018 goals is to make the appStudio accelerator and _**Lean Product Framework**_ available for mass consumption through Lessonly.
- Attached are the appStudio press release and a <a href="/assets/images/article-resources/appstudio-ldj.jpg">photo of the teams performing the Lightning Decision Jam</a>.

## In Closing
I would like to recognize Ian and Donovon for working closely with Veena and Bai to tailor the appStudio to the very unique outcomes that the MOS team wanted to achieve. Ian had a chance to record a discussion with the leaders at the appStudio, <a href="https://ge.box.com/s/newajnvclsecyxwtlud1wcj9g0eejvcb" target="_blank">you can see it here</a>.  
 
Cheers,
David
